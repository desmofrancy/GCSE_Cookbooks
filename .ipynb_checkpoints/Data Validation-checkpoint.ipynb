    "### DIFFERENT TYPES OF VALIDATION\n",
    "Because the user will make mistakes, and crashing the program every time they do would be frustrating in the extreme, we can write code that validates the user’s input before carrying on. Validation doesn’t mean that the user always enters something that is correct (such as a correct combination of username and password), but it means that the format of their user input is correct. A complete list of the necessary validation for our user’s guess would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "* minimum length (they need to enter something – this particular instance of checking minimum length is called a presence check)\n",
    "* type (the input should be able to converted to an integer)\n",
    "* range (the integer representation of their input should be between 1 and 100)\n",
    "\n",
    "The actions that result from the input not passing any of these validation attempts should be to prompt the user to enter another guess and, if we were being helpful, to be given a message that explains why their input wasn’t valid. The high-level plan for this is:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. user enters a guess\n",
    "2. if the length of this guess is zero then\n",
    "    1. output an error message\n",
    "    2. go to 1\n",
    "3. convert the input to an integer \n",
    "4. if this causes an error\n",
    "    1. ‘catch’ the error\n",
    "    2. output an error message\n",
    "    3. go to 1\n",
    "5. if the integer is not between 1 and 100\n",
    "    1. output an error message \n",
